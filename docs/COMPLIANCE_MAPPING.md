# SOC2 / ISO 27001 Mapping (PHASE-6.8)

Purpose: Map controls to implementations so compliance evidence is generated by the system.

## Control Mapping

- Access Control: Tenant isolation, RBAC
- Change Management: PR enforcement
- Audit Logging: Immutable events
- Incident Response: Chaos tests + runbooks
- Data Protection: Namespacing + quotas
- Availability: Lease recovery
- Monitoring: Prometheus + alerts

## Evidence Generated

- PR history
- Migration logs
- Metrics snapshots
- Chaos test results
- Runbooks
- Access logs

## Outcome

- SOC2 Type II readiness
- ISO 27001 alignment
