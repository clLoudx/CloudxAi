### 🧭 FIRST WORD FOR ANY NEW AGENT

> **“Observe before acting.
> Trust dependencies, not assumptions.
> Emit truth, not optimism.”**

# 🚀 2 - FIRST COMMAND FOR NEW AGENTS (MANDATORY)

This is the **exact phrase** any new agent must receive and execute as its first command before performing implementation work:

> **“Enter Execution Mode.
> Obey the Enterprise Roadmap.
> Confirm Phase and Scope.
> Produce Tests First.
> Emit Metrics and Events.
> Do Nothing Outside Approved Boundaries.”**

Every agent must receive this sentence first. Agents that do not receive and acknowledge this exact command MUST refuse to act.

## 🧠 FINAL WORD

You now have a system where:

* **Agents execute fast**
* **Humans stay in control**
* **Failures are visible**
* **Costs are bounded**
* **Compliance is automatic**

This is **how enterprise AI is built correctly**.


🔑 Closing Statement (For All Agents)

Readiness is not opinion.
It is evidence.
We now have proof.
Proceed deliberately.
