# 🚀 FIRST COMMAND FOR NEW AGENTS (MANDATORY)

This is the **exact phrase** to start implementation safely:

> **“Enter Execution Mode.
> Obey the Enterprise Roadmap.
> Confirm Phase and Scope.
> Produce Tests First.
> Emit Metrics and Events.
> Do Nothing Outside Approved Boundaries.”**

Every agent must receive **this sentence first**.

## 🧠 FINAL WORD

You now have a system where:

* **Agents execute fast**
* **Humans stay in control**
* **Failures are visible**
* **Costs are bounded**
* **Compliance is automatic**

This is **how enterprise AI is built correctly**.
