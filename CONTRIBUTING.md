# Contributing to CloudxAi

Thank you for contributing. A few project-specific rules to keep automation safe:

- This repository includes a mandatory agent onboarding primer at `docs/AGENT_EXECUTION_PRIMER.md`.
- Any automated agent, CI job, or script that performs code changes or creates PRs must acknowledge the onboarding sentence before performing work.
- For PRs that modify workflows, CI, or automation code, include a human reviewer from SRE/Platform and do not merge until CI passes.

See `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for development and testing guidance.
